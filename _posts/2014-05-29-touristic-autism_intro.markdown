# Rails Girls Touristic Autism-friendly Spots App Tutorial

*Created by Myriam Leggieri, [@iammyr](https://twitter.com/iammyr)*
*for [Rails Girls Galway](https://github.com/RailsGirlsGalway)*


This guide merges, adapts and extends some of the basic RailsGirls guides **for the scenario**: visualization of touristic places in Galway (Ireland) that are autism-friendly. This application was requested by the [Galway Autism Partnership](http://www.galwayautismpartnership.com/). 

The extension comprises of the following **new features**:

* TDD using Guide
* Resource Rating
* Authenticated User (via devise) permission setting

The basic guides that have been merged and adapted are the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://www.railstutorial.org/book), the [basic RailsGirls app](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/) and the tutorials for [creating thumbnails](http://guides.railsgirls.com/thumbnails), [authenticating users](http://guides.railsgirls.com/devise/), [adding design](http://guides.railsgirls.com/design), [deploying to OpenShift](http://guides.railsgirls.com/openshift/) and [adding comments](http://guides.railsgirls.com/commenting).

## Undoing things

Rails has some facilities to help you recover from mistakes. 

For instance, you may decide to change the name of a controller. Since, when generating a controller, Rails creates many more files than the controller file itself, undoing the generation means removing a whole set of files. In Rails, this can be accomplished with rails destroy. In particular, these two commands cancel each other out:

  $ rails generate controller FooBars baz quux
  $ rails destroy  controller FooBars baz quux

Similarly, after we generate a model as follows:

  $ rails generate model Foo bar:string baz:integer

This can be undone using

  $ rails destroy model Foo


Migrations change the state of the database using

  $ rake db:migrate

We can undo a single migration step using

  $ rake db:rollback

To go all the way back to the beginning, we can use

  $ rake db:migrate VERSION=0

As you might guess, substituting any other number for 0 migrates to that version number, where the version numbers come from listing the migrations sequentially.

To drop a table from the db enter

  $ rails console

Then just type:

  >> ActiveRecord::Migration.drop_table(:<table-name>)

You can browse directly the database (if sqlite3 type ".quit" to exit afterwards) by typing

  $ rails db
